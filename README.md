## Get started without an AWS account

If you are new to AWS, you don't need an AWS account to get started. You can still model and test your data before deploying to the cloud. After building your data model, you must connect an AWS account to deploy your backend environment to Amplify using Amplify Studio.

| Figma to code                  | To accelerate UI development, Amplify Studio uses the Amplify UI library to offer dozens of components such as news feeds, contact forms, and e-commerce cards and primitives such as buttons, text areas, and alerts. All UI components are fully customizable within Figma, giving designers complete control over the visual styling of components within tooling they are familiar with. All Figma components are imported into Studio as React components that are as good as hand-authored code. | ![](https://docs.amplify.aws/images/console/ui-figmatocode.png) |
