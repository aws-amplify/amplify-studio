AWS Amplify Studio is a visual development environment for building fullstack web and mobile apps. Studio builds on existing backend building capabilities in AWS Amplify, allowing you to accelerate your UI development as well. 

With Studio, you can quickly build an entire web app, front-to-back, with minimal coding, while still maintaining full control over your app design and behavior through code. Ship faster, scale effortlessly, and delight every user.
